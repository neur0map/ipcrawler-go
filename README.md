## üéì What IPCrawler Does (For Fellow Students)

IPCrawler is basically a "Swiss Army knife" for penetration testing that I built to help with my Hack The Box practice sessions and CTF challenges. Instead of remembering all those nmap flags and running tools manually, it automatically runs multiple security tools in organized workflows.

### ‚ö° **Automated CLI Tool** 
- Runs all security tools automatically with one command
- Clean progress output shows what's happening in real-time
- No need to remember complex command-line flags
- Organized output logs for easy analysis
- Smart workflow execution saves tons of time on HTB!

### ‚ö° **Automated Security Scanning**
- **Port Scanning** - Finds open ports on targets (great for HTB enumeration phase)
- **DNS Enumeration** - Discovers subdomains and DNS records
- **Service Detection** - Identifies what's running on those ports
- **Concurrent Execution** - Runs multiple scans at the same time (saves tons of time!)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tools I Integrated** (with AI help!)
- **Nmap** - The classic port scanner everyone uses
- **Naabu** - Super fast port scanner for when Nmap is too slow
- **Nslookup** - DNS queries and enumeration
- **Easy to add more** - YAML config files make it simple

### üìã **Workflow System** (My Favorite Part!)
Instead of remembering all those command flags and options, I created "workflows" that run common penetration testing sequences:
- **Reconnaissance workflow** - Does the initial target discovery
- **DNS enumeration workflow** - Finds all the DNS info
- **Port scanning workflow** - Comprehensive port analysis

## üéÆ How to Use (Perfect for HTB!)

### Getting Started (Super Easy!)
```bash
# Just run it with your target - works with IPs, domains, whatever
ipcrawler 10.10.10.10          # HTB machine IP
ipcrawler example.com          # Domain name  
ipcrawler 192.168.1.0/24       # Network range

# Need admin privileges for some scans? No problem:
sudo ipcrawler 10.10.10.10
```

### Real HTB Example Workflow
```bash
# Start scanning an HTB machine - it runs ALL workflows automatically!
ipcrawler 10.10.10.87

# What happens:
# 1. Automatically discovers and runs all available workflows
# 2. Port scanning workflow executes (nmap + naabu)
# 3. DNS enumeration workflow runs (nslookup queries)
# 4. Real-time progress shows in terminal
# 5. All results saved to organized log files
# 6. Ready for your HTB writeup!
```

### Output & Logging
- **Automatic execution** - No interaction needed, just run and wait
- **Progress indicators** - See what's running and completed  
- **Organized logs** - Results saved in structured directories
- **Verbose mode** - Add `-v` flag for detailed output
- **Clean output** - Easy to parse for writeups

### Pro Tips for Students
```bash
# See what tools are available
ipcrawler registry list

# Verbose mode (see detailed output)
ipcrawler -v target.com

# Debug mode (see everything that's happening)
ipcrawler --debug target.com

# Check the generated logs after scanning
ls local_files/logs/
```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works (For the Curious)

**Full transparency:** Most of the complex architecture was implemented with heavy AI assistance since I'm still learning advanced Go programming. But understanding how it works helps me learn!

### The Main Parts (AI helped me design this!)

1. **The Main CLI** (`cmd/ipcrawler/main.go`)
   - Simple command-line interface that just takes a target
   - Automatically discovers and runs all available workflows
   - Shows real-time progress with clean output formatting

2. **The Engine** (`internal/executor/`)
   - **engine.go** - Actually runs the security tools
   - **progress.go** - Shows those cool progress indicators 
   - **template_resolver.go** - Replaces `{{target}}` with your actual target
   - **tool_config.go** - Loads settings from YAML files

3. **Configuration** (`configs/` folder)
   - All the settings in easy-to-edit YAML files
   - Security policies to keep things safe
   - UI customization options

4. **Workflows** (`workflows/` folder)
   - Pre-built scanning sequences for common pentesting tasks
   - Easy to modify for your specific needs
   - Organized by category (reconnaissance, enumeration, etc.)

### Cool Features I Learned About
- **Template Variables** - Use `{{target}}` in configs and it gets replaced with your actual target
- **Session Saving** - Remembers your last target when you restart
- **Concurrent Execution** - Runs multiple tools at the same time
- **Safety Checks** - Validates inputs to prevent accidents

## üìÅ Customization (Easy to Tweak!)

One of the coolest things about this project is that everything is configurable through simple YAML files. Even as a beginner, I can easily modify how tools behave without touching code!

### Main Settings (`configs/` folder)
```yaml
# ui.yaml - Change colors, themes, performance settings
# security.yaml - Safety limits and validation rules  
# output.yaml - Where logs go and how detailed they are
# tools.yaml - Timeout settings and execution limits
```

### Tool Settings (`tools/` folder)
```yaml
# nmap/config.yaml - All the nmap scanning options
# naabu/config.yaml - Fast port scanner settings
# nslookup/config.yaml - DNS query configurations
# reusable.yaml - Variables you can use everywhere
```

### Workflow Definitions (`workflows/` folder)
```yaml
# reconnaissance/ - Basic target discovery workflows
# DNS-Scanning/ - DNS enumeration sequences  
# descriptions.yaml - What each workflow does
```

### Want to Add a New Tool?
1. Create `tools/newtool/config.yaml` 
2. Define how it should run
3. Add it to a workflow
4. Done! (This was way easier than I expected thanks to the AI design)

## üî® Development (Learning Journey)

**Note:** This section is for the development installation only. Production users can skip this!

As a student learning to code, I found these Make commands super helpful for building and testing:

### Development Commands (AI taught me these!)
```bash
# Building and Testing
make build       # Compile Go source into binary
make run         # Test the CLI tool locally  
make dev         # Auto-rebuild on file changes (great for learning!)
make test-all    # Run comprehensive test suite

# Installation and Deployment
make easy        # Create global symlink to your dev build
make install     # Install to $GOPATH/bin (alternative method)
make clean       # Clean build artifacts
```

### Testing Commands (Important for Learning!)
```bash
make test-all      # Complete test suite
make test-static   # Verify CLI architecture correctness
make test-deps     # Check dependency versions
make test-ui       # Test CLI application functionality
```

### Learning by Adding Tools (My Favorite!)
This is how I'm actually learning more about penetration testing:

1. **Study existing patterns** - Look at `tools/nmap/config.yaml`
2. **Create new tool config** - Make `tools/mytool/config.yaml` 
3. **Add to workflows** - Include in `workflows/reconnaissance/`
4. **Test on HTB machines** - Real-world validation!
5. **Iterate and improve** - Learn from what works

**Development tip:** Use `make dev` while coding - it auto-rebuilds when you save files!
